## Setup Instrctions for React Applications

First, create a new React application with Visual Studio:

Then click next and create.

Once that's done, head over to the command line. For the commands below, I'll be using `MyReactApp` and `MyReactApp.Web` as the name of the solution/project. Replace it with whatever you named yours.

When you start the command line you should be at:

```
c:\Users\YourUserName>
```

From there, type the following commands:

```
cd source
cd repos
cd MyReactApp
cd MyReactApp.Web
```

Your console should now show something like the following:

```
c:\Users\YourUserName\source\repos\MyReactApp\MyReactApp.Web>
```

Once there, run the following command:

```
lit-react
```

Once that's done, you can close the command line and go back to Visual Studio. Hit F5 like you normall would, and after some time, your browser should launch and you should be greeted with the following page:

....and you're done! Good luck.
